 1.       Run LR, SVM, RF, MLP 

2.       Drop MomICU from the predictor variables

3.       Outcome variable sets:  transf_yes, trans_loss, trans_hyst (drop hysterectomy)

4.       Use only the RANDOM selected dataset, drop all the other cohorts

5.       Produce results with:

a.       ROC-AUC

b.       Recall

c.       Precision

d.       Accuracy

e.       F1 score

f.        Coefficients if available in the algorithm

g.       Table with mean rankings for predictors across all four algorithms: LR, SVM, RF, MLP

6.       Plot or figure to demonstrate items in 4  not sure which one maybe compare the ROC  which would give us a  plot with 4 lines very close together

7.       Look at the option of using an ensemble model

 

We will meet again one week after Thanksgiving
