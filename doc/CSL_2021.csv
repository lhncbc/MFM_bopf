Recent innovations in population-level data collection and storage have made available an unprecedented amount of data for analysis while computational technology has evolved to permit processing of data previously thought too dense to study. ""Big data"" is a term used to describe data that are a combination of dramatically greater volume, complexity, and scale. The number of variables in typical big data research can readily be in the thousands, challenging the limits of traditional research methodologies. Regardless of what it is called, advanced data methods, predictive analytics, or big data, this unprecedented revolution in scientific exploration has the potential to dramatically assist research in obstetrics and gynecology broadly across subject matter. Before implementation of big data research methodologies, however, potential researchers and reviewers should be aware of strengths, strategies, study design methods, and potential pitfalls. Examination of big data research examples contained in this article provides insight into the potential and the limitations of this data science revolution and practical pathways for its useful implementation.",2017-02,2021-04-16 14:11:33,2021-04-16 14:11:33,,249-264,,2,129,,Obstet Gynecol,Advanced Research and Data Methods in Women's Health,,,,,,,eng,,,,,PubMed,,PMID: 28079771,,,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28079771,,"Biomedical Research; Data Collection; Data Interpretation, Statistical; Gynecology; Humans; Obstetrics",

Alternative measures such as positive predictive value (PPV) and the associated Precision/Recall (PRC) plots are used less frequently. Many bioinformatics studies develop and evaluate classifiers that are to be applied to strongly imbalanced datasets in which the number of negatives outweighs the number of positives significantly. While ROC plots are visually appealing and provide an overview of a classifier's performance across a wide range of specificities, one can ask whether ROC plots could be misleading when applied in imbalanced classification scenarios. We show here that the visual interpretability of ROC plots in the context of imbalanced datasets can be deceptive with respect to conclusions about the reliability of classification performance, owing to an intuitive but wrong interpretation of specificity. PRC plots, on the other hand, can provide the viewer with an accurate prediction of future classification performance due to the fact that they evaluate the fraction of true positives among positive predictions. Our findings have potential implications for the interpretation of a large number of studies that use ROC plots on imbalanced datasets.",2015,2021-04-16 14:12:16,2021-04-16 14:12:16,,e0118432,,3,10,,PLoS One,,,,,,,,eng,,,,,PubMed,,PMID: 25738806 PMCID: PMC4349800,,C:\Users\rodriguezlm2\Zotero\storage\NTWKI4K9\Saito and Rehmsmeier - 2015 - The precision-recall plot is more informative than.pdf; ,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25738806,,Classification; Datasets as Topic; ROC Curve,

We aimed to investigate the association of hemorrhage risk assessment with maternal morbidity and to evaluate maternal outcomes after implementation of the risk assessment across hospital sites. STUDY DESIGN: We conducted a retrospective cohort analysis of a multicenter database including women admitted to labor and delivery from January 2015 to June 2018. The Association of Women's Health, Obstetric and Neonatal Nurses risk assessment tool was used to categorize patients as low, medium, or high risk for hemorrhage. Multivariate logistic regression was used to describe the association between hemorrhage risk score and markers of maternal morbidity and evaluate maternal outcomes before and after standardized implementations of the risk assessment tool. RESULTS: In this study, 14,861 women were categorized as low risk (26%), 26,080 (46%) moderate risk, and 15,730 (28%) high risk (N = 56,671 births). For women with high-risk scores, the relative risk (RR) ratio compared with low-risk women was 4.9 (RR: 95% confidence interval [CI]: 3.2-7.4) for blood transfusion and 5.2 (RR: 95% CI: 4.6-5.9) for estimated blood loss (EBL) ≥ 1,000 mL. For the second objective, 110,633 women were available for pre- and postimplementation analyses (39,027 and 71,606, respectively). A 20% reduction in rates of blood transfusion (0.5-0.4%, p = 0.02) and EBL ≥ 1,000 mL (6.3-5.9%, p = 0.014) was observed between pre- and postimplementations of the admission hemorrhage risk assessment tool. CONCLUSION: Women who were deemed high risk for hemorrhage using a hemorrhage risk assessment tool had five times higher risk for blood transfusion and EBL ≥ 1,000 mL compared with low-risk women. Given the low incidence of the outcomes explored, the hemorrhage risk assessment works moderately well to identify patients at risk for peripartum morbidity. KEY POINTS: · This study aimed to understand the utility of the AWOHNN hemorrhage risk assessment tool for predicting hemorrhage-related morbidity and to evaluate maternal outcomes before and after tool implementations.. · A high score using a hemorrhage risk assessment tool on admission is associated with five times higher risk for blood transfusion and/or estimated blood loss ≥ 1,000 mL, compared with a low score.. · Use of a hemorrhage risk assessment tool works moderately well to identify patients at highest risk for hemorrhage-related morbidity..",2020-05-23,2021-04-16 14:12:57,2021-04-16 14:12:57,,,,,,,Am J Perinatol,Hemorrhage Risk Assessment on Admission,,,,,,,eng,,,,,PubMed,,PMID: 32446252,,,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32446252,,,

METHODS: Discharge data from birth hospitalizations in California during 2016-2017 were used to develop the score. The outcomes were severe maternal morbidity, defined using the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention index, and nontransfusion severe maternal morbidity (excluding cases where transfusion was the only indicator of severe maternal morbidity). We selected 27 potential patient-level risk factors for severe maternal morbidity, identified using International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification diagnosis codes. We used a targeted causal inference approach integrated with machine learning to rank the risk factors based on adjusted risk ratios (aRRs). We used these results to assign scores to each comorbidity, which sum to a single numeric score. We validated the score in California and national data sets and compared the performance to that of a previously developed obstetric comorbidity index. RESULTS: Among 919,546 births, the rates of severe maternal morbidity and nontransfusion severe maternal morbidity were 168 and 74 per 10,000 births, respectively. The highest risk comorbidity was placenta accreta spectrum (aRR of 30.5 for severe maternal morbidity and 54.7 for nontransfusion severe maternal morbidity) and the lowest was gestational diabetes mellitus (aRR of 1.06 for severe maternal morbidity and 1.12 for nontransfusion severe maternal morbidity). Normalized scores based on the aRR were developed for each comorbidity, which ranged from 1 to 59 points for severe maternal morbidity and from 1 to 36 points for nontransfusion severe maternal morbidity. The overall performance of the expanded comorbidity scores was good (C-statistics were 0.78 for severe maternal morbidity and 0.84 for nontransfusion severe maternal morbidity in California data and 0.82 and 0.87, respectively, in national data) and improved on prior comorbidity indices developed for obstetric populations. Calibration plots showed good concordance between predicted and actual risks of the outcomes. CONCLUSION: We developed and validated an expanded obstetric comorbidity score to improve comparisons of severe maternal morbidity rates across patient populations with different comorbidity case mixes.",2020-09,2021-04-16 14:13:50,2021-04-16 14:13:50,,440-449,,3,136,,Obstet Gynecol,,,,,,,,eng,,,,,PubMed,,PMID: 32769656 PMCID: PMC7523732,,,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32769656,,Adult; Comorbidity; Female; Humans; Pregnancy; Pregnancy Complications; Risk Factors; Severity of Illness Index,

METHODS: Predictive models were constructed and compared using data from 10 of 12 sites in the U.S. Consortium for Safe Labor Study (2002-2008) that consistently reported estimated blood loss at delivery. The outcome was postpartum hemorrhage, defined as an estimated blood loss at least 1,000 mL. Fifty-five candidate risk factors routinely available on labor admission were considered. We used logistic regression with and without lasso regularization (lasso regression) as the two statistical models, and random forest and extreme gradient boosting as the two machine learning models to predict postpartum hemorrhage. Model performance was measured by C statistics (ie, concordance index), calibration, and decision curves. Models were constructed from the first phase (2002-2006) and externally validated (ie, temporally) in the second phase (2007-2008). Further validation was performed combining both temporal and site-specific validation. RESULTS: Of the 152,279 assessed births, 7,279 (4.8%, 95% CI 4.7-4.9) had postpartum hemorrhage. All models had good-to-excellent discrimination. The extreme gradient boosting model had the best discriminative ability to predict postpartum hemorrhage (C statistic: 0.93; 95% CI 0.92-0.93), followed by random forest (C statistic: 0.92; 95% CI 0.91-0.92). The lasso regression model (C statistic: 0.87; 95% CI 0.86-0.88) and logistic regression (C statistic: 0.87; 95% CI 0.86-0.87) had lower-but-good discriminative ability. The above results held with validation across both time and sites. Decision curve analysis demonstrated that, although all models provided superior net benefit when clinical decision thresholds were between 0% and 80% predicted risk, the extreme gradient boosting model provided the greatest net benefit. CONCLUSION: Postpartum hemorrhage on labor admission can be predicted with excellent discriminative ability using machine learning and statistical models.

Epidemiological studies about anaphylaxis are very important in planning and evaluating new strategies that prevent this reaction, but also in providing a guide to the treatment of patients who have just suffered an anaphylactic reaction. Electronic Medical Records (EMR) are one of the most effective and richest sources for the epidemiology of anaphylaxis, because they provide a low-cost way of accessing rich longitudinal data on large populations. However, a negative aspect is that researchers have to manually review a huge amount of information, which is a very costly and highly time consuming task. Therefore, our goal is to explore different machine learning techniques to process Big Data EMR, lessening the needed efforts for performing epidemiological studies about anaphylaxis. In particular, we aim to study the incidence of anaphylaxis by the automatic classification of EMR. To do this, we employ the most widely used and efficient classifiers in text classification and compare different document representations, which range from well-known methods such as Bag Of Words (BoW) to more recent ones based on word embedding models, such as a simple average of word embeddings or a bag of centroids of word embeddings. Because the identification of anaphylaxis cases in EMR is a class-imbalanced problem (less than 1% describe anaphylaxis cases), we employ a novel undersampling technique based on clustering to balance our dataset. In addition to classical machine learning algorithms, we also use a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify our dataset. In general, experiments show that the most classifiers and representations are effective (F1 above 90%). Logistic Regression, Linear SVM, Multilayer Perceptron and Random Forest achieve an F1 around 95%, however linear methods have considerably lower training times. CNN provides slightly better performance (F1 = 95.6%).",2018-11,2021-04-16 14:16:11,2021-04-16 14:16:11,,50-59,,,87,,J Biomed Inform,,,,,,,,eng,,,,,PubMed,,PMID: 30266231,,,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30266231,,"Algorithms; Anaphylaxis; Bag of centroids; Balancing strategies; Big Data; Cluster Analysis; Decision Making; Electronic Health Records; EMR classification; Humans; Language; Linear Models; Machine learning; Machine Learning; Medical Informatics; Neural Networks, Computer; Regression Analysis",
