# MFM Documentation Directory
As of 20Aug2022 our manuscript is still awaiting publication. I will update this page 
once it is accepted. Our submitted manuscript can be found here: [MachineLearningManuscript](MachineLearningManuscript.pdf)

# Lessons Learned
At the completion of this project, I (Mike Bopf) wrote up a Lessons Learned document of 
my personal experiences and what I would do differently. It can be found here: 
[LessonsLearned](MFMLessonsLearned.pdf)

The rest of the documents in this directory are mostly historical and could be a bit
out of date. The following powerpoint presentation by Laritza Rodriguez provides a good
initial overview: [MFM_database_research](MFM_database_research.pdf)
